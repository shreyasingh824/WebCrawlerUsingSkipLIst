Web crawling is a component of web scraping, the crawler logic finds URLs to be processed by the scraper code. A web crawler starts with a list of URLs to visit, called the seed. For each URL, the crawler finds links in the HTML, filters those links based on some criteria and adds the new links to a queue.
